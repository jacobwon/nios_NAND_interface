	<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
			NAND flash memory is extensively used for mass storage purpose. They have found their usage in SSDs., memory cards and are also used in almost all the gadgets in todays electronic ecosystem. A number of research focused on NAND memory or flash memory in general are performed focusing primarily in using these memory for security purposes, securing data, making efficient storage strategy etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this research, we present an interface to the NAND memory, specifically Open NAND Flash Interface (ONFI 2.2) with NIOS computer system. The NIOS computer system is implemented in DE1-SoC where the computer runs at 100Mhz frequency. Most of the research work presented for NAND flash memory do not reveal the interface they use or it just seems the interface frequency is a bottleneck in the systems. Thus we wanted to create infrastructure for interested parties such that they can modify the content as their own need.

		<p>
			Technical requirments are:
			<ul>
				<li>The memory has to be ONFI confirmant.</li>
				<li>The pinout should be TSOP.</li>
				<li>Please verify and change the pin configuration in the code based on your hardware setting.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Althuogh, this implemtation is based on NIOS computer in DE1-SoC system, you can pretty much use it with any microcontroller changing the value of following variablesL
			<ul>
				<li>JUMPER_LOCATION</li>
				<li>JUMPER_DIRECTION</li>
				<li>All the mask values</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	<h1>Technical Details</h1>
		<h2>Computer System</h2>
			<p>
				NIOS computer system is a soft core processor that can be instantiated on Intel FPGA device which can be programmed into the FPGA using Intel Platform Designer program that comes integrated with Quartus. It is a complete computer system and thus a complete description of NIOS system is out of scope for this document. Any interested reader should follow the pdf document as this <a href="ftp://ftp.intel.com/Pub/fpgaup/pub/Intel_Material/17.0/Tutorials/Nios2_introduction.pdf">link</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of the different versions of the architectures of NIOS, we are using the "fast" or <i>NIOS II/f</i> comfiguration. Since it is softcore, you can choose whatever you want to program into the FPGA fabric.
			</p>
			<p>
				The platform that we are using is DE1-SoC system. The basic NIOS computer system for DE1-SoC system is provided by Intel under University Program. No change in the basic computer system is made as of this point.
